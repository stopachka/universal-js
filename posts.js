How we look at making money, friendships, love, etc forms the construct of the way we see the world, the way we see ourselves, and the way we interact with others. But, these are just beliefs, they aren't reality. Losing a belief can happen in a flicker of an eye, and your entire life starts to dissassemble. \n\nI'm beginning to see why the life of entrepeneurship leads people into mental breakdowns! Our entire lives are basically beliefs that we set for ourselves, and most of the time they aren't validated by anyone else. That can get pretty scary.",

If you think that you should be financially rewarded because you are honest, hard-working, and kind to old people and pets, you're in for a very disappointing life.\n\nNo matter how you feel about something, it doesn't change that it's going to happen. This occurs to me in two situations. One, I practice something, and I feel the pain, but I know it will lead to the results I want, and the actual situation has no negatives in the first place. Two, I avoid something becuase I don't want to think about it.\n\nA perfect example of the latter -- In Taiwan I was having trouble finding living accomodations, so I ignored it.

I wanted to -->\n\nLearn Chinese\n\nGet a girlfriend\n\nStart Suca Diving\n\nGrow my business by working 10 hours / week\n\nLaunch a web app\n\nTake the SATs for Oxford ( I am a Canadian, and didn't take them before. Our universities didn't need it ) \n\nNow, the first logical question was...why the hell did I want to do all of this?\n\nthan why would I want to do all of this at the same time? \n\nI dream for, and I live for building a strong business, building up family, growing my skillsets and ability to interact with people. I think the reason someone chooses to live is largely arbitrary, but that's what I have chosen. I have a choice not to do any of these things, but I can't imagine living without doing this. Though this doesn't address the second question \n\nWhy would I want to do all of this at the same time? \n\nThere are twenty four hours in a day. I know what my capabilities are. Why not stagger these things out over 10 years? In 10 years I'll be 29 years old. If I were to have a million dollars in the bank, have a strong family, speak 4 languages...and scuba dive, I would be fine. if I were to stagger these goals, and it doesn't have to be 10 years, I have a real shot at achieving them.\n\nThough, that isn't what I am doing. \n\nThe second question is what I have been struggling with. I feel like many people don't answer the second question. I see intelligent driven people attacking at all fronts, diluting their ability to win. \n\nFor me, it was born out of a fear. A sense of urgency. I felt that if I weren't to accomplish this now, I would never be able to do it. I would be a failure to my parents, my friends, and myself. \n\nIt's a lack of trust in yourself. If you were to do only one thing, your confidence hinges on it. Your dreams begin to clash with the world. You start to see where the edges of your capability lie.\n\nThat's what I'm beginning to see. There is no forskaing one thing to do another. There is no urgency. There is only action. Step by step.",

    "content": "Life comes with a series of complex, never ending questions. Sometimes, people are able to keep their sanity and function with the words of Seneca, Boethius, Jesus Christ, Muhammed and other systems of thoughts (Recently, celebrities have replaced some of these icons). These words are more valuable to humans than any sort of money or material object, for it helps us live our lives without too many questions. However, their massive appeal and usability lead to their downfall, because it's impossible to share the same reference point of the author, and hence many ideas don't apply to you, and you don't know which ones.\n\nFor instance, look at the problem with homosexuality in the bible. Be good, and don't be gay. For a large majority of people, they'll be good, and they won't be gay. They weren't gay in the first place, so it's no problem. But, what of the other 1%? This mass adoption of values causes so much anxiety, stress, and destroyed relationships. \n\nLife is like playing professional basketball. You can read about all the players, and you can know every team, and you can think you'll know who's going to win and why, but you won't be playing basketball. These values have a lot of merit, but by simply learning the values, we never learny _why _they were set in the first place. We can't replicate being Seneca, and hence we can't know why he said what he said. \n\nMy father told me this many times, but I never truly understood. Take the words of the philosopher, but your only true teacher is experience. It is what tells you right and wrong. Form your own opinions, and test them in the real world. At least that's the only way, for me at least, to stay true to myself.",

    "content": "This last month, a multitude of lessons were learned from the school of hard knocks. Working hard, making and breaking relationships, and seeing where my limits are currently.\n\nThis all lead to a swing in net worth, and a swing in my outlook of the world. I'll try to share what I've learned, though everything's too close to home currently for me to objectively break things down.\n\nThe most important lesson I've gotten is based on how I looked at the world. I had a very Japanese classical-eraish look at the way people and business worked. I though that the way my family treated me would permeate through my business associates and friends. I wanted to look out for other people's interest, and trust that they would look out for myne. This would lead to a much cleaner, happier exchange. No haggling necessessary. \n\nThe common side effect to thinking like this is that you become very intimate with people very quickly. If that's you, please read on. \n\nYou meet someone to do business, or make a new friend, or a new relationship, and you're ready to do many things. You're ready to make commitments, or to sacrifice your health, things important to you, to take care of their interests. This way of treating people isn't necessarily wrong. Again, I do this with my fmaily, and I am absolutely greatful for the kind of relationship I share with them. \n\nThe problem with permeating this type of thining throughout is that these privelages have to be earned. A new friend, a new relationship can't possibly earn intimacy to that effect. \n\n99% of people don't see the type of good will that you're creating. You're only setting yourself up to be burned. When you see that they don't reciprocate, you swing 100% the other way. You start to feel bretrayed by the other person. \n\nThat's the second side effect. If your appraisal of a person shifts wildly, please read on.\n\nThis is a very fucking childish way of doing business, or living life. \n\nFirstly, people need to earn that type of good will. It takes going to war together, for years on end, to really develop a relationship like that. When you meet someone and try to manufucture that experience, it's fake. It leads you to appraise people badly, and to generally do bad work and leave unfinished projects.\n\nMy lesson is to keep people around the middle. No more wild shifts. Be professional, make backup plans, and make sure you think to yourself, how can this person fuck me in this situation. Than, try to make it so they don't have the option to fuck you.\n\nThis doesn't mean to be hostile and bitter. That's the same as being immediately loving, it's fake. Simply put a question mark on their character, until you see it in real life. let them prove themeselves, and let yourself be proven to them.",

But, it'll be okay I tell myself. I get more an more anxious, until I end up getting up.\n\nGreat. Just enough time to go to the gym fast, eat bad food, and be 20 minutes late. \n\nHow do you act, when you wake up like that all the time?

That I didn't have any control over my life.\n\nI blamed it at a lot of things. My sleep schedule is screwed up. I have more commitments than I could have coneived of before. Business is growing, and it's causing me stress. \n\nI've met a lot of people this year, and I think if you're a startup founder, or an artist, or an extremely ambitious student, you get this type of feeling.

I just had enough lax in my schedule that I could have dealt with sloppy habits. \n\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\n\nIf you believe in that quote, the answer isn't to scale back on what you believe will create change. The answer is to build a better life for yourself. \n\nDo it little by little. \n\nI'm going to start by fixing my sleeping schedule.\n\nThen, no more sugar.\n\nAfter that, maybe no hackernews",

    "content": "Van Gogh, Shakespeare, Winston Churchill, Charles Dickens. All of these people have used their creativity to reimagine something in a new light, to instigate change and create master works. All of these people, also experienced varying degrees of depression.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, Isaac Newton, and the list continues. It's devastatingly too common that so many thought leaders of our generation experience depression. In effect Psychological studies indigate that depression and creativity are linked. However, we've seen over and over again how devastating it can be. When people spiral for too long, they fall to such lows thay they break down or commit suicide. We've lost a lot of great minds, and excellent ideas because of the way we handle depression, and I'm writing this post to suggest an alternative, a way to be creative without letting yourself break down.\n\nFirst, let's set scopes on Depression. I identify it as a sense of hopelessness and existential dread, that is prolonged for an _unnatural_ period of time. The unnatural period of time is the literal killer. It's the spiraling into more and more severe dread, until it gets impossible to get out. If it wasn't for the spiraling effect, depression would be a completely healthy experience everyone would grow from. One facet of it, \"Rumination\" is particularily helpful for creativity. Rumination is defined as the \"compulsively focused attention on the symptoms of one's distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its solutions.\" For example, when you ask a girl out and say something stupid, you \"ruminate\" for the next hour about how stupid what you said was. This introspection to identify mistakes, truly understand yourself and ponder on life can be the instigator to some great ideas.\n\nBut, what kills is the spiraling effect. A sense of hopelessness piled up ontop of more hopelessness. An insight I've had on this is that it usually happens when there are _multiple_ things wrong. Instead of just ruminating over one thing, people are lonely, they don't eat healthy, exercise, their place is dirty. In short _their life is more supporting of depression_.\n\nThis was the case with me. I had a lot of things going right, but I had a horrible diet, I didn't work out enough, I didn't meet new people, so when a small roadblock showed up, it was hard to bounce back. Each depression lead to some creative insights for my business and life, but I could see where the trend was headed.\n\nAlmost all creativity in life is basically negated if you can't get out of depression. It only has to happen once, than it's kind of over. But, I don't want to feel normal all the time. I want to be happy, and I want to be sad. I _want_ to reflect and be creative.\n\nThat's when it hit me. It was a pretty simple thought, but it was big for me. I started to change the environment around me. I wanted to allow myself to ruminate and feel depressed, but I wanted _everything_ around me to dispell the other factor of depression.\n\nI started regulating my sleep, making sure there was healthy food all aorund me, making sure I had a social circle that I could check in with. I regularily talked with my family, and built in periods for relaxation and seeing nature in my schedule.\n\nI'm still on this path, but my goal is to create an environemnt around me that is possible by default. This will allow me experience the swings and be creative, while at the same time allow for me to jump back.\n\nIf you're an entrepneur or an artist, I highly suggest asking you this question : What are the default standards in my life right now?\n\nHow can you change those standards for the better, so that when you're in down swing it can help life you up?",

This will outline the steps I'm taking, as I'm taking it.\n\n===\n\n**1) Google search Angular learning resources.

The reason I don't jump right into making an MVC app is because I'd like to have a slightly deeper technical understanding of Angular and it's best practices.\n\n**Update on 2) --** Wow! I really enjoyed this tutorial. Excellent way to cover ground. When taking it, I suggest you make your own local version of the app that you'll be creating on it. It'll help you internalize much better.\n\n**3) Time to look for tutorials on integrating Angular with a backend**\n\nI've got an understanding of Angular's core features, but one open question is how Angular handles data via a RESTful API. I'll be searching for tutorials on making it. Another question I have is about how to best structure an app using angular, and when to use custom directives, etc. I think to get a better sense of this, making an actual Rails App would teach a bunch.\n\nRight now, I'm thinking of making an app to save all of your favorite ideas, but before getting into it, I have 2 other considerations to think about. There's a coding challenge I'll be at in a few days, and I'd like to set up a dev environment for it. Once done with that, I also want to knowt the basics of react.js. Before any of that, I also have a bunch of consulting work to finish off.\n\nWill be back on updating this post in a few days.\n\n**4) Teach Allen a what I learned**\n\nWhile doing the immediete client objectives, I moved along with Angular learning, with an interesting experiment -- a great coder friend of myne and I have been switching roles as teachers to eachother -- this time I taught him what I learned with Angular. It helped cement some thoughts, and exposed what I didn't know. Very useful.\n\n**5) Discovered Great Rails and Angular Tutorial**\n\nWas scowering around for a tutorial that would help cement routing and services for Angular. Usually there's always a 'build a blog with x and y' tutorial, so I searched it up and found something excellent -> https://github.com/asanderson15/rails-angular-tutorial",

It included lessons learned from the past, and a new outlook on objectives for the next six months.\n\nToday, I opened my notebook to plan the next 6 month's objectives. To start, I wanted to get a better sense for what the future held, so I drew a timeline. On that timeline, I filled in my 'must do's', the things I was certain would need to be on the calendar. On the side, I put all potential goals.\n\nThis produced some surprising results for me. For my 'must to do's', I had only about 20 days filled. And for my potentials, everything seemed to be up in the air, dependent on each other. The possible combinations were too varied to think about.\n\nFor most of my life, I had much more must do's, which allowed me to more clearily make choices.\n\nThe skills needed to make choices in that scenario aren't so useful in this one.\n\nSo, what does work? The first thing that comes to mind is to ignore all choices that depend on other choices -- they are too up in the air, and the number of possible combinations will make your brain explode.\n\nOnly focus on the decisions you can immedietly act on.\n\nHowever, this can introduce a secondary problem, where by focusing too short-term, you end up missing out on longer-term investments.\n\nA perfect example of this, for me, was language learning. For the first year that I was in Beijing, I didn't put much effort into learning Mandarin. I was more focused on business and immediete goals, and thought I wouldn't have enough time to become fluent. One year passed, I started learning Mandarin, and boy do I wish I learned for that year!\n\nso the soluton looks like, focus on more immediete decisions, but assume that you will be in your current state for longer.

The work wouldn't be great if you didn't think the problem you were solving was hard. You might have to learn a lot of new things, or have to face the dreaded 'am I good enough?' question.\n\nWhen you're doing high-upside, application oriented events, you also get the same feeling. If we liked writing applications and selling, we would be in sales and no development.\n\nThen it follows the limit to doing great work, or winning in a high upside event is bound by the level of uncertainty you can handle.\n\nTake applying for excellent schools or companies. The excellent ones are the ones that are least likely to be particularily impressed by you.\n\nThis gets us to sell too quickly. In order to avoid the discomfort, you might be tempted to take the very first offer, or to choose an easier challenge that doesn't quite make you work as hard.\n\nAnd the thing about the level of discomfort you can handle is that the choice becomes an unconcious one. It's not that we choose to settle early, or take on less challenging pursuits, but they become a default, rationalized behavior.\n\nThe way to get yourself out of it is by watching other people.

I deliberately underminded what they said, and made a very strong statement - like I _hate_ beauracratic, class based systems. \n\nNow, that was not what they meant. Thankfully, they're my parents, and they love me, and they don't seem to share this temperament, so they calmly moved the conversation elsewhere.\n\nBut why did I say that? I would usually defend this in the name of wanting to convey something that will be better for the other, but today I realized that's not the case. \n\nIt could better be described as me trying to get a rise out of them.\n\nBut why?\n\nWell, I guess the way to narrow the search is to look for things that were outside of normal that day.\n\nFirst, I had a sore throat.\n\nSecond, other things were on my mind.\n\nBoth chipped away at my frontal lobe, is the best way I can put it.\n\nPresence and cognicance.

My assumption was that the more arguments I had, the more likely I was to change my mind, and therefore see reality, be smarter. \n\nBut, I think arguing, at least verbally, may have an opposite effect. When you argue with someone, you're invested in being right. It's painfully to be wrong in a social context, and perversley it's like a competition. I imagine it's similar to what gorillas or teenagers do when they see a woman. \n\nThe second effect that can be argued, the noble act of changing another's mind for the better, is also nil. I don't think I can think of a time where an argument helped change a person's mind. Why is that? Well, the first idea that people get emotionally intrenched applies, but also I think changing your mind is immensley difficult, and therefore requires something of equivelant weight. Arguing isn't good enough. It needs to be more visceral, to be seen. \n\nSo, how should you approach it? I think writing essays to convey your thoughts might be a way. I also think showing with action is a much stronger way. In anything I've been good at, no one listened to me at first, but when results showed, it became easy to speak my thoughts.",

Follow instructions, participate in politics, exercise superficial power.\n\nAt first I thought I'd just ignore it, but something odd started happening. I was planning on printing something, but didn't go into a large retailer, because I knew I had to fight for hours to override their policy and let me go to a website to print something. \n\nMy enthusiasm for travel diminished a bit, because I knew I had to possibly deal with border officials. I was scared of police officers. No, I'm not a drug dealer, but I sure as hell felt like one.\n\nIgnoring bureaucracy was getting in the way of my life. Instead of asipiring to be resourceful, like in almost all other aspects of my life, I just shut down when it came to bureaucracy. \n\nThat fricking sucked, as you could imagine. The story gets better though. \n\nIt's much easier to deal with it once you learn of their ways. Here's some point form thoughts, that I might make into longer piece later, but here's to it being helpful either way.\n\n1) Never argue or get angry with Bureaucrats. Almost everyone thinks that they can somehow convince them using their charisma. This won't happen. If a border official wants to give you bullshit, the more cavalier you speak, the more opportunity you're giving them to screw you over.\n\n2) Instead, you must act like a bureacrat. If they ask you for papers, provide all the papers. If they say they can't do something, ask them to give you a copy of the document that says that. If they say they can't give you the document, ask them for a copy of the document that says they can't give you the document.\n\n3) Be patient and cordial, and know that there is no way you're going to deal with this normally. Simply persevere, give documents, ask for documents, and if it comes to it, exercise your ability to speak to a higher up person.\n\n4) It's important to never, ever, ever, get angry though, or say a white lie.

There are Supervisors, and Actors, which encapsulate internal state, and talk to eachother via messages.\n\nThis seems more complex, but actually, it is simpler when looked at by the lens of distributed software. It's complex to keep a single state in sync when you're across datacenters.\n\nWhat Erlang does is, to essentially embrace the distributed nature of the problem, and goes by the assumption that if each Supervisor takes care of what it's responsible for well, then the system will work.\n\nThis was a pretty breakthrough parallel for me, in my task management. Instead of trying to build a top down system, it's all about making sure the small parts work well.\n\nGetting Things Done, by David Allen, is the Erlang of task management x)",

The reason is that I honestly knew that I am imposing, but I also felt that it is rude of them to talk to me in the way that they do. When I react, it isn't congruent with the type of person I want to be, and I feel off long after. One time, a man interrupted me as I was sittings outside of a cafe, and I told him, 'I am sorry, though it is outside'. He misheard me, and thought I said 'I am sorry, but we are excited', he laughted and empathized. I realized, this was the secret -- from now on, instead of reacting back, make light of it. It saves face for both of us, and is congruent with who I am. This kind of lesson applies throughout life -- instead of getting angry, taking it lightly, empathize.",
